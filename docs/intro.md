# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Complete Course

## Welcome to the Future of Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This course takes you on a journey from foundational ROS 2 concepts to cutting-edge Vision-Language-Action systems, preparing you to build the next generation of intelligent humanoid robots.

## Course Overview

This course is structured into four comprehensive modules that progressively build your expertise in physical AI and humanoid robotics:

### [Module 1: ROS 2 - The Nervous System](./module-1-ros2/intro.md)
Learn the foundation of modern robotics with ROS 2, the communication framework that enables all components of a robotic system to work together seamlessly.

### [Module 2: Digital Twin - The Virtual Body](./module-2-digital-twin/intro.md)
Explore digital twin technologies using Isaac Sim and Unity, creating virtual environments for robot development, testing, and validation before real-world deployment.

### [Module 3: AI-Robot Brain - The Cognitive System](./module-3-ai-brain/intro.md)
Dive into artificial intelligence for robotics with NVIDIA Isaac tools, implementing perception, reasoning, and cognitive capabilities that enable intelligent robot behavior.

### [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - The Natural Interface](./module-4-vla/intro.md)
Master multimodal AI systems that enable natural human-robot interaction through vision, language, and action integration.

### [Capstone Project: Integrated Physical AI & Humanoid System](./capstone/index.md)
Apply everything you've learned by creating a complete integrated system that demonstrates advanced capabilities in autonomous humanoid robotics.

## Learning Path

The recommended learning path is sequential:

```
Module 1 → Module 2 → Module 3 → Module 4 → Capstone Project
```

Each module builds upon the previous one, so it's important to complete them in order. The Capstone Project integrates concepts from all four modules into a comprehensive system.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:
- Basic programming experience (preferably Python)
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Access to appropriate hardware or simulation environment

## Course Goals

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Design and implement complex robotic systems using ROS 2
- Create and validate robots in digital twin environments
- Implement AI-powered perception and cognitive systems
- Build natural interaction systems using Vision-Language-Action
- Integrate all components into professional-level robotic applications
- Apply safety and ethical considerations to AI-robotics systems

## Technology Stack

This course leverages state-of-the-art technologies:
- **ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill** - Robot operating system framework
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** - Advanced robotics simulation
- **NVIDIA Isaac ROS** - GPU-accelerated perception and navigation
- **OpenAI Whisper** - Speech recognition for natural interaction
- **Large Language Models** - Cognitive planning and reasoning
- **Unity** - Advanced visualization and simulation (optional)
- **Gazebo** - Physics-based simulation environment

## Getting Started

Begin your journey by starting with [Module 1: ROS 2 - The Nervous System](./module-1-ros2/intro.md). Each module contains comprehensive theoretical foundations, practical examples, hands-on exercises, and assessment questions to ensure you master each concept before moving forward.

The course is designed to take approximately 80-100 hours to complete, depending on your prior experience and the depth of exploration you pursue in each module.
