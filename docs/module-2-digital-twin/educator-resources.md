## Introduction

Teaching digital twin concepts in robotics requires specialized approaches that combine theoretical understanding with practical implementation. This chapter provides educators with resources, strategies, and best practices for effectively teaching Module 2 content to students with varying backgrounds and learning styles.

Digital twin education presents unique challenges and opportunities:
