# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics – Professional Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Comprehensive, Professional Course Book Structure
All content must follow a structured textbook format with clear learning objectives, theoretical foundations, practical examples, hands-on exercises, and safety guidelines. Content must be organized into well-defined chapters with consistent pedagogical approach.

### Deterministic, engineering-grade writing only
All content must be deterministic and engineering-grade with no invented APIs, commands, or robotics frameworks. Verified content aligned with ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim/Isaac ROS, and official documentation.

### Reproducible, testable labs and code
All content must be reproducible and testable, following deterministic templates with safety-first approach for all humanoid robotics tasks. Every example and exercise must include clear setup instructions, expected outcomes, and troubleshooting guidance.

### Markdown + Docusaurus compatible structure
All content must match official documentation and be compatible with Markdown + Docusaurus structure, with all diagrams text-described and properly integrated into the learning flow.

### Git-friendly file structure
All content must follow Git-friendly file structure with stable paths and semantic versioning, organized by modules and chapters for easy maintenance and updates.

### Educational Excellence and Accessibility
All content must be designed for diverse learning styles with clear explanations, real-world applications, and progressive complexity. Content must include assessment rubrics, learning checkpoints, and educator resources.

### Zero hallucinated APIs
Deterministic content with zero hallucinated APIs, Docusaurus builds without error, organized versioned Git repo, with all content verified against official documentation.

## Standards
All content must match official documentation, all diagrams text-described, all chapters/labs follow deterministic templates with learning objectives, theory, practical examples, exercises, and safety guidelines. Git-friendly file structure with stable paths, semantic versioning, and consistent pedagogical approach across all modules.

## Constraints
Comprehensive yet focused content with clear learning objectives, no speculative robotics behavior, all instructions must be ethically and operationally safe, content must be reproducible and verifiable, chapters limited to appropriate length for educational effectiveness.

## Governance
All content must be deterministic, engineering-grade with verified content aligned with ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim/Isaac ROS. Success measured by comprehensive textbook structure, reproducible code, zero hallucinated APIs, Docusaurus builds without error, organized versioned Git repo, and educational effectiveness. Constitution overrides all instructions, any change requires version bump.
