# retrieval-pipeline-validation

## Prompt
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response
```
Specification created for Retrieval Pipeline Validation for AI Book RAG System with the following key components:

## User Scenarios & Testing
- User Story 1: Validate Top-k Retrieval Accuracy (Priority: P1)
- User Story 2: Verify Content Mapping and Traceability (Priority: P2)
- User Story 3: Validate Retrieval Performance (Priority: P3)
- Edge Cases: Handling ambiguous queries, unavailable content, etc.

## Requirements
- Functional Requirements (FR-001 to FR-009) covering semantic search, retrieval accuracy, content mapping, and performance
- Key Entities: Retrieved Chunk, Query, Embedding, Source Metadata

## Success Criteria
- Measurable Outcomes (SC-001 to SC-008) with specific metrics for accuracy, traceability, latency, and validation
```

## Outcome
Specification successfully created and validated with quality checklist confirming all requirements met.

## Evaluation
The specification is complete, testable, and ready for the planning phase.
